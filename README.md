# NCAA_Tableau_Dashboard

This GitHub repository hosts the visualizations for NCAA Division I Womenâ€™s Basketball ticket sales predictions, developed using a Tableau dashboard named "Court Vision." The project leverages customer and external data to predict ticket purchases and determine market types (primary or secondary). The dashboard illustrates key customer engagement metrics, purchase trends, and predictive model accuracy. Highlights include Indiana's leading ticket sales, a 4.4% increase in purchase activity, and the Random Forest model achieving 98.661% accuracy. The visualizations effectively communicate insights, supporting strategic marketing and enhancing the student-athlete experience. The repository includes detailed documentation on the data used, the creation of visualizations, and instructions on how to set up and interact with the dashboard.
